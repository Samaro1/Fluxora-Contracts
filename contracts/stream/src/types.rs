/// Namespace for all contract storage keys.
///
/// # Evolution policy
///
/// `DataKey` is a `#[contracttype]` enum. Soroban serialises enum variants by
/// their **discriminant index** (0-based, in declaration order). Changing the
/// order of existing variants, or inserting a new variant anywhere other than
/// the **end** of the enum, will silently shift all subsequent discriminants
/// and make every existing persistent storage entry unreadable.
///
/// Rules for contributors:
/// 1. **Never reorder** existing variants.
/// 2. **Never remove** a variant that has ever been written to a live network.
///    Mark it deprecated in a doc comment instead and stop writing to it.
/// 3. **Always append** new variants at the end of the enum.
/// 4. **Increment `CONTRACT_VERSION`** whenever a new variant is added or an
///    existing variant's associated type changes — both are breaking changes
///    for any off-chain tool that reads storage directly.
/// 5. Document the ledger at which each variant was first deployed so that
///    migration tooling can determine which entries exist on a given instance.
///
/// Current discriminant assignments (must never change) — see enum definition below for order.
